For Gen 3 live battery manipulation

While PokeFinder has a lot of functionality, one feature it's missing is "time to seed." This is necessary for live battery manipulation, since the initial seed will change depending on the cartridge's internal clock

The program takes the year, month, day, hour (in 24-hour time to account for AM/PM), and minute and outputs the seed associated with that time. While the current version only generates a single seed, future versions will also display the next four seeds, once data validation is added to account for miscalculations that currently plague the beta version
